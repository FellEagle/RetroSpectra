# RetroSpectra


*** What ***

Retrospectra is a Python + Flask web application that allows users to search for any historical figure, event, war, or item.
It fetches structured information (title, summary, link, and images) from Wikipedia and displays it in a modern, stylish interface.

Key Features:

           - Search bar with real-time queries
           - First relevant Wikipedia image display
           - Title, summary, and link to full Wikipedia page
           - Beautiful glassmorphism UI (CSS styled)
           - Uses Wikipedia API (via wikipedia Python library)


*** Why ***

- Searching history on Wikipedia is powerful but often cluttered. This project was built to:
- Provide a focused, clean interface for exploring history.
- Learn and implement Flask (backend) + HTML/CSS (frontend).
- Practice integrating an external API into a Python web project.
- Serve as a base for future improvements like AI summaries, multiple sources (Wikidata/DBpedia), and timelines.


*** How ***

       - Backend: Python (Flask)
       - Frontend: HTML, CSS (custom design with glassmorphism)
       - API/Data Source: Wikipedia API (wikipedia Python package)
